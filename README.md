## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

```bash
# Initializing setup sequence...
# Please ensure all prerequisites are met.
```

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   A Neon Database instance (or any PostgreSQL compatible database)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Competooo
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and populate it with the following variables:

    ```dotenv
    # Database Connection String (e.g., from Neon)
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"

    # A strong, random string for session signing (e.g., generated by `openssl rand -base64 32`)
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_super_secret_key_here"

    # Vercel Blob Storage (if used for asset uploads)
    BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your_vercel_blob_token"

    # Other potential environment variables (e.g., for Bunny.net, Vimeo, YouTube APIs)
    # BUNNY_API_KEY="your_bunny_api_key"
    # VIMEO_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_vimeo_access_token"
    # YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your_youtube_api_key"
    # PAYMOB_API_KEY="your_paymob_api_key"
    ```

    _Note: The `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is crucial for session security. Ensure it's a long, random, and securely stored string._

4.  **Database Setup:**
    Ensure your Neon Database (or equivalent) is provisioned and accessible via the `DATABASE_URL`. The application expects certain tables (`users`, `sessions`, `videos`, `quizzes`, etc.) to be present. If this is a fresh setup, you might need to run database migrations. Check the `scripts/sql` directory or `server/db.ts` for any migration-related logic.

## ▶️ Running the Application

```bash
# Executing application startup script...
# Initiating development server.
```

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if configured).
```

### Production Build

To build the application for production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Start Production Server

To start the application in production mode (after building):

```bash
npm run start
```

## 🛡️ Authentication & Authorization Deep Dive

```bash
# Security Protocol: Active
# Analyzing access matrix...
```

The platform implements a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure data integrity and user privacy.

-   **`middleware.ts`:** This Next.js middleware intercepts all incoming requests. It checks for a `session_id` cookie, validates it using `getCurrentUser` from `lib/auth.ts`, and determines the user's role.
    -   **Public Routes:** `/`, `/login`, `/_next/*`, `/api/*` are accessible to all. If a logged-in user tries to access `/login`, they are redirected to their respective dashboard.
    -   **Protected Routes:**
        -   `/admin/*`: Only accessible by users with the `admin` role. Unauthorized users are redirected to `/login` or `/access-denied`.
        -   `/teacher/*`: Accessible by users with `teacher` or `admin` roles. Unauthorized users are redirected.
        -   `/student/*`: Accessible by users with `student` or `admin` roles. Unauthorized users are redirected.
-   **`lib/auth.ts`:** Contains the core logic for `getCurrentUser`, which queries the database to validate session IDs and retrieve user details (ID, role, name, grade, avatar_url).
-   **`lib/auth-provider.tsx`:** A React Context provider that makes the authenticated user's session data available to client-side components via the `useAuth` hook, enabling dynamic UI based on user roles.

## 📊 Data Model (High-Level Overview)

```bash
# Database Schema: Loading...
# Entity-Relationship Diagram (Conceptual):
```

The application interacts with a PostgreSQL-compatible database (e.g., Neon Database) with a schema designed to support the various functionalities. Key entities include:

-   **`users`:** Stores user information (ID, name, email, password hash, role, grade, avatar_url, phone, etc.).
-   **`sessions`:** Manages user sessions for authentication.
-   **`videos`:** Stores details about educational videos (ID, title, description, category, URL, thumbnail_url, teacher_id, is_free, month, created_at, etc.).
-   **`quizzes`:** Stores quiz definitions (ID, title, description, teacher_id, etc.).
-   **`questions`:** Stores individual quiz questions.
-   **`answers`:** Stores possible answers for quiz questions.
-   **`student_quiz_attempts`:** Records student attempts on quizzes.
-   **`messages`:** For chat functionalities (sender, receiver, content, timestamp).
-   **`photos`:** For photo sharing features (ID, user_id, url, caption, etc.).
-   **`likes`:** Records likes on photos or other content.
-   **`comments`:** Stores comments on photos or other content.

_Note: This is a high-level overview. Refer to the `server/sql` directory or relevant server-side query files for exact schema details._
